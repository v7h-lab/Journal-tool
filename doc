Preparing the HTML
Turn.js uses a DOM element as a container for all the pages. This
DOM element is typically the flipbook. There are three ways to add
pages to your flipbook:
1. Adding pages directly in the container. The HTML
contains all the content of your flipbook. For example:
<div id=”flipbook”>
<div>Page 1</div>
<div>Page 2</div>
<div>Page 3</div>
<div>Page 4</div>
</div>
2. Adding pages dynamically through the API. The HTML
contains only the container and all the pages will be dynamically
added after getting the data through an Ajax Request. For
example:
<div id=”flipbook”>
<!— Load the content here-->
</div>
3. A combination of both. Sometimes it’s a better idea to have
some pages in the HTML and another loaded dynamically. For
example:
<div id=”flipbook”>
<div>Front1</div>
<div>Front 2</div>
<!— Load the content here-->
<div>Back 2</div>
<div>Back 1</div>
</div>
Performance
Turn.js can work with very long flipbooks. That is, there’s no limit
regarding the amount of pages that it can contain. This is because
turn.js only keeps in DOM the last 6 pages no matter how long the
book is. There will still be references to the content that was
previously loaded, but it’s possible to reduce the cache in order to
release memory.
IE8/7 Support
The turn.js library includes turn.html4.js, which is optimized for IE 8
as well as any other browsers with no support of CSS3 features
such as transformation. You can use CSS tricks to include
turn.html4.js for older versions of IE, but it’s recommended to use
the Modernizr library and a resource loader like YepNope.js both
available on modernizr.com. For instance the following JavaScript
code:
yepnope({
test : Modernizr.csstransforms,
yep: ['lib/turn.js', 'css/flipbook-html5.css']
nope : ['lib/turn.html4.js', 'css/flipbook-html4.css']
});
CSS Classes
Turn.js uses classes to define the way a page or the flipbook as a
whole should look. The classes also allow you to add CSS rules or
use them as a selector for that page.
List of classes

1. even

This class describes even pages when display is set to double.
For example: Page 2, Page 4, and so on. Notice that even
pages will always be in the right of the flipbook.
2. fixed
Indicates that a page should not be removed from the DOM
even when the page is out of range.
3. hard
Sets a hard transition effect for a page.
By setting all the pages as hard you will create the same
effect as in Flipboard.
For example:
<div id=”flipbook”>
<div class=”hard”>Page 1</div>
<div class=”hard”>Page 2</div>
</div>

4. odd

This class describes odd pages when display is set to double.
For example: Page 1, Page 3, and so on. Notice that odd
pages will always be in the left of the flipbook.
 
5. own-size

Customizes the size of a page. The size rules can be added
directly to the page selector or using the style parameter.
For example:
<div id=”flipbook”>
<div>Page 1 with default size</div>
<div class=”own-size” style=”width:100;
height:100px;”>
Page 2 with own size
</div>
</div>
6. page

This class describes every page. It provides a unique subclass
for all the pages no matter its number.
This subclass allows you to set the size of all the pages:
.flipbook{
width:800px;
height:600px;
}
.flipbook .page{
width:400px;
height:600px;
}
 7. p[0-9]+
This class describes a particular page. For instance, .p1 refers
to the first page, .p2 to the second page and so on.
You can change the number of a page no matter its order in
the HTML:
<div id=”flipbook”>
<div class=”p100”>Page 100</div>
<div class=”p1”>Page 1</div>
</div>
You can also use it as a jQuery selector:
$(‘#flipbook .p100’).doSomething();
8. shadow

This class describes the visible area of the flipbook. That is,
because it surrounds the flipbook, it’s suitable for a shadow
around the flipbook. For example:

.flipbook .shadow{
box-shadow: 0 4px 10px #666;
}

9. sheet
Makes the page looks like a sheet of paper. This is the
default style for all the pages.
Setting the size of the flipbook
There’re three ways to set the size of a flipbook.
1) Using CSS, for example:
.flipbook{
width:800px;
height:600px;
}
.flipbook .page{
width:400px;
height:600px;
}
Notice that the width of the page is half the size of the
flipbook.
2) Using options, for example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn({width:800, height:600});
3) Using the size method, for example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘size’, 800, 600);
Display
The display defines how many pages are visible in the flipbook.
While using turn.js on an iPad or iPhone, there would be some
problems to turn pages if the orientation of the device is portrait.
For that reason, turn.js introduces a new view called single. There
are two views: double, which shows two pages and single, which
shows only one page.
Views
A view is a set of pages that are visible on the screen; in general
that moment depends on the current page. For example, when the
display of a flipbook of 10 pages is set to double, the pages would
be grouped like this:
1
2-3
4-5
6-7
8-9
10
This flipbook has 6 views. The general relation is: totalPages/2 +1
Therefore, if the current page is 5, the view in double display would
be: [4,5]
Using display single, the view will always have only one page. So,
there will be the same number of pages and views.
Ignoring elements in the flipbook
Turn.js reserves an HTML attribute called ignore which can be added
to some elements in the flipbook to not select them as pages. For
example:
<div id=”flipbook”>
<div ignore=”1”> Something else </div>
<div>Page 1</div>
<div>Page 2</div>
<div ignore=”1”> Something else </div>
<div>Page 3</div>
</div>
Corners
The corners identify every interactive region on the flipbook. For
example:
 
Description:

tl: Top Left.
tr: Top right.
r: Right (hard pages only)
br: Bottom right.
bl: Bottom left.
l: Left (hard pages only)
Constructor
The constructor is the function that will turn the container into a
flipbook. Because turn.js uses a single instance, it’s not necessary
to have an external reference to it.
Example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn([options]);
Notice that the constructor only has one argument called options
and it’s optional.
Options
The options define characteristics of the flipbook. All the keys are
optional.
Option Type Default value Description
acceleration Boolean true
Sets the hardware
acceleration mode, for
touch devices this value
must be true.
autoCenter Boolean false
Centers the flipbook
depending on how many
pages are visible.
display String single Sets the display mode.
Values: single, double
duration Number 600
Sets the duration of the
transition in milliseconds
gradients Number true
Shows gradients and
shadows during the
transition.
height Number Height of the
selector
Sets the height of the
selector
inclination Number 0 Sets the inclination of the
page during the transition
page Number 1 Sets the first page
pages Number The number of
pages in the DOM Sets the number of pages
when Object {} Sets event listeners
width Number Width of the
selector Sets the width of the page
Adding options to the constructor:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn({
display: ‘double’,
inclination: 50,
when: {
turned: function(event, page, pageObj) {
alert(‘the current page is ’ + page);
}
}
});
Properties
Syntax:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘propertyName’);
List of properties
• animating
Returns true when animating a page.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘animation’);
• display

Gets the current display. It can be single or double.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘display’);
• page

Gets the current page.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘page’);
• pages
Gets the number of pages within the flipbook
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘pages’);
• size

Gets the size of the flipbook. It would be an object with two
keys, width and height.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘size’);
• view
Gets the current view.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘view’);
• zoom
Gets the current zoom. The default value is 1.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘zoom’);
Methods
Syntax:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘method name’[, argument1, argument2]);
When a method doesn’t return a value, it can be connected to
another methods, for example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘method1’).turn(‘method2’);
List of methods
• addPage
Adds a page to the flipbook.
Parameter Type Description
element jQuery
element DOM element for the page.
pageNumber Number
Page Number
This parameter is optional and the default
value is:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘pages’)+1
For example:
element = $(‘<div />’, {class: ‘p10’});
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘addPage’, element);
The above code is equivalent to:
element = $(‘<div />’);
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘addPage’, element, 10);

• display

Set the display.
Parameter Type Description
displayMode String
It can be single or double.
Single means one page per view, meanwhile
double two pages per view.

$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘display’, ‘single’);

• disable

Disables and enables the effect. If it’s disabled, users won’t
be able to change the current page.
Parameter Type Description
disable Boolean
True to disable the effect or false to
enable.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘display’, ‘single’);
• destroy

Destroys the flipbook. That is, it removes all the pages from
the DOM and memory.
For example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘destroy’);
 $(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘page’, 1);

The last line will throw an error. You can also remove the
container, for example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘destroy’).remove();

• hasPage
Returns true if a page is in memory.
Parameter Type Description
pageNumber Number Page number.
For example:
if ($(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘hasPage’, 1)) {
alert(‘Page 1 is already in the flipbook’);
}
• next
Turns the view to the next one. For example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘next’);
• is

Detects if a selector has an instance of turn.js. For example:
 
if (!$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘is’)) {
// Create a new flipbook
$(‘#flipbook’).turn();
}
• page
Turns the page.
Parameter Type Description
page Number Page number.
For example, the following example will turn the page to 10.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘page’, 10);
• pages
Sets the number of pages that the flipbook has. If the number
of pages is less than the current one, it will remove the pages
out of range.
Parameter Type Description
pages Number Number of pages.
For example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘hasPage’, 10); // It’s true.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘pages’, 5); // Sets 5 pages
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘hasPage’, 10); // Returns false
• peel
Shows a peeling corner.
Parameter Type Description
corner String Corner type.
The corners can be: tl, tr, bl, br, r, l.
For example:
// To show the br corner
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘peel’, ‘br’);
// To hide all the corners
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘peel’, false);
• previous
Turns the view to the previous one. For example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘previous’);

• range
It returns an array of two values where the first element
refers to a page from which next pages should be contained
in DOM. The second element refers to the last page of the
range. That is, the current range always has the following
relationship: range[0] <= current page <= range[1]
Parameter Type Description
pageNumber Number
A page number within a range. This parameter
is optional and the default value is
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘page’);
For example, in order to add new pages dynamically, it’s
necessary to use the range method:
var range = $(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘range’, 10);
for (var page = range[0]; page<=range[1]; page++){
if (!$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘hasPage’, page)) {
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘addPage’,
$(‘<div />’), page);
}
}
The last example will add the pages that are closest to the
page 10. Assuming that display is double, those pages would
be [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
• removePage
Removes a page from the DOM and all its references.
Parameter Type Description
pageNumber Number Number of the page to remove.

For example:

$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘removePage’, 10);
• resize

Recalculate the position of all the pages.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘resize’);


• size
Sets the size of the flipbook.
 Parameter Type Description
width Number New width for the flipbook.
height Number New height for the flipbook.
For example:

$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘size’, 1000, 600);
• stop
Stop the current animation. For example, it’s possible to turn
to a page without having animation.
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘page’, 10).turn(‘stop’);
• zoom

Increases or reduces the size of the flipbook.
Parameter Type Description
factor Number
Factor of multiplication. For example, 2 would
increase in twice the size of the flipbook;
meanwhile 0.5 would reduce the size to half of
its current size.
duration Number Duration in milliseconds of the scaling
animation. The default value is 500.


For example, to zoom out without animation:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘zoom’, 0.5, 0);
Events
The events allow you to define behaviors to specific moments. It’s
possible to define events in two different ways:
1. Using the when key of options

While adding event listeners, it will require to add the listeners
before the constructor creates the flipbook. For example:
$(‘#flipbook’).turn({
when: {
turning: function(event, page, pageObject) {
}
}
});
2. Using bind
jQuery provides a bind function in order to add listeners to
elements. You can use bind to add as many listener as you
need for an event. For example:
$(‘#flipbook’).bind(‘turning’,
function(event, page, obj){
alert(‘Page ’+ page);
});

Using the event object
The first argument that all the listener functions share is the event
object, which allows you to manipulate the propagation and default
action of the event.
Some events are followed by an action that can be, for instance, to
turn the page. Therefore, it’s possible to prevent that action by
using event.preventDefault(); within the event function. It’s not
necessary to return false to prevent the default action.
List of events
• end
This event is triggered after ending the motion of a page.
Parameter Type Description
event Event Event object. 
page Number The page number
pageObject Object The page data

• first
This event is triggered when the current page is 1. Parameter Type Description
event Event Event object.

• last

This event is triggered when the current page is
$(‘#flipbook’).turn(‘pages’). That is, the last page.
 Parameter Type Description
event Event Event object.


• missing

This event is triggered when some pages are required in the
current range.
Parameter Type Description
event Event Event object.
pages Array Pages that must be added.
You can use this event to add pages through addPage. For
example:
$(‘#flipbook’).bind(‘missing’, function(event, pages){
for (var i = 0; i < pages.length; i++) {
$(this).turn(‘addPage’,
$(‘<div />’), pages[i]);
}
});
• start

This event is triggered before starting the motion of a page.
Parameter Type Description
event Event
The event object. The default action is to start
the animation. Preventing the default action,
there wouldn’t be interaction with any corner.
pageObject Object The page object.
corner String Corner Type.
The corners can be: tl, tr, bl, br.
For instance, if you want to allow only corners at the bottom
of the page, you can use the start event:
$(‘#flipbook’).bind(‘start’,
function(event, pageObject, corner){
if (corner==’tl’ || corner==’tr’) {
event.preventDefault();
}
});
You can also use the start event to change the next page of
the current page:
$(‘#flipbook’).bind(‘start’,
function(event, pageObject, corner){
if (pageObject.page==1) {
// pageObject.next of the 1st page is 2,
// but let’s change it:
pageObject.next = 4;
}
});
• turning
This event is triggered before the flipbook turns the page.
Parameter Type Description
event Event The event object. The default action is to allow
the flipbook to turn to a page.
page Number The new page number
view Array The new view

• turned

This event is triggered after the flipbook turned the page.
Parameter Type Description
event Event The event object.
page Number The new page number
view Array The new view

• zooming
This event is triggered when the zoom factor is changed.
Parameter Type Description
event Event The event object. The default action is to
zoom.
newFactor Number The new zoom factor
current Number The current zoom factor
